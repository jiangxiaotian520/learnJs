Waiting for the sunset

Long street with faint light
Stores open all night
Some guys are drawn into a street -fight
They don't know what their life is like
And so do I

Fire burning on the side street
I faster my feet
Towards the direction of east
I should take one risk at least

Full of hunter
Full of anger
Full of hunger
Driving me crazy
It's easy
Just go back the start street
